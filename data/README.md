# Datasets used in Experiments
All of scripts and notebooks assume that the preprocessed data for all the various
experiments are located in one of the directories here:
* DLPFC
* SCC
* HER2
* Spinal-Cord

All of the preprocessed versions of these datasets are available on [zenodo](https://sandbox.zenodo.org/record/1026068#.Yh-4l5PMLRY)

**TODO**: there will be a bash script that will download all relevant files from
zenodo to these folders.
