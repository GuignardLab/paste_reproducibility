# Paste reproducibility
Code to reproduce the analysis and figures in the Paste manuscript.

## Datasets
* **TODO**: Decide where we will host datasets.

## Main figures
* **TODO**: Populate this section with links to the notebooks to reproduce
figures. Place all notebooks in notebook folder, we can decide on the structure
later but probably we will subdivide notebooks into the separate folders of analyses. 
For example, 
* [Figure 1](notebooks/place_holder.py)

## Supplementary figures
* **TODO**: Same process as main figures.
