# Paste reproducibility
Code to reproduce the analysis and figures in the Paste manuscript.

## Datasets
* All preprocessed datasets can be found on [zenodo](https://sandbox.zenodo.org/record/1026068#.Yh-4l5PMLRY). 
* For convenience there is a script called
[`download_data.sh`](scripts/download_data.sh) that
will download all the relevant files to the [data](data/) directory in the
correct hierarchy.

## Main figures
* **TODO**: Populate this section with links to the notebooks to reproduce
figures. Place all notebooks in notebook folder, we can decide on the structure
later but probably we will subdivide notebooks into the separate folders of analyses. 
For example, 
* [Figure 1](notebooks/place_holder.py)

## Supplementary figures
* **TODO**: Same process as main figures.
